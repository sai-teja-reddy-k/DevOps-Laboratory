Introduction

This repository serves as a hands-on environment for exploring and experimenting with DevOps practices. You will find a collection of scripts, tutorials, and practical exercises to help you understand the core principles of DevOps.

Some of the key concepts covered in this lab include:

Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Delivery (CD)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Containerization and Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)

Automation (Ansible, Jenkins)

Monitoring and Logging (Prometheus, Grafana)

Installation

To set up the DevOps Laboratory on your local machine, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites:

Docker (For containerization)

Kubernetes (For orchestration)

Git (For version control)

Terraform (For infrastructure provisioning)

Ansible (For configuration management)

Jenkins (For CI/CD pipelines)

You can install these tools using their respective installation guides:

cd devops-laboratory

Set up the environment:

Each project in this repository may have specific setup instructions. Check the README or setup instructions within each folder for details.

Docker:

If you're running Docker-based labs, ensure Docker is up and running. You can start Docker containers using:

docker-compose up

Kubernetes:

For Kubernetes-related exercises, ensure your cluster is running, and apply Kubernetes YAML configurations as required by the lab.

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/

Usage
CI/CD Pipeline Example

This repository contains examples of Jenkinsfiles for setting up Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines. To use them, make sure you have a Jenkins instance running. You can configure the Jenkins pipeline by following these steps:

Go to your Jenkins dashboard.

Create a new pipeline job.

In the pipeline configuration, point to the Jenkinsfile in this repository.

Containerization Example

You can build Docker images for the apps provided in the repository by navigating to the Dockerfile directory and running the following command:

docker build -t devops-laboratory-app .


Once built, you can run the container:

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 devops-laboratory-app

Kubernetes Example

To deploy to a Kubernetes cluster, apply the configuration files provided in the kubernetes/ folder:

kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
